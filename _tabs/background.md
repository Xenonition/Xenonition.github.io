# Introduction
A smart building is a structure that leverages a network of embedded devices to enhance efficiency, security, and overall performance. As buildings continue to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives and work, the value of making them "smarter" is only growing. By utilizing sensors, networks, and analytics, a smart building can monitor and optimize energy usage, resulting in significant energy savings. It can also regulate temperature, lighting, and air quality to meet the individual preferences of occupants, ultimately enhancing their quality of life. The smart building not only improves comfort but also reduces maintenance costs and promotes sustainability, making it the new standard for any hub of activity.

# Problem
UCSD has initiated the deployment of various smart building technologies in some of its buildings, such as the student center and computer science building, due to the high volume of students visiting these locations. Improving the efficiency of these buildings is crucial because a significant portion of their operational costs is attributed to energy consumption. By monitoring energy usage through sensor data and analytics, substantial savings can be achieved. Additionally, identifying areas for energy conservation can aid in reducing the building's greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from cost savings, energy usage insights can also facilitate adherence to building codes and regulations and the detection of malfunctioning systems.
