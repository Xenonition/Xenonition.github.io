# Model Insights
As of now, among all the models utilized in the project, the decision tree model is the only one that met the requirements and constraints. Although the mean squared error of 4.44 requires improvement, the model was implemented without any errors and functions well. Additionally, the simplicity of the model makes it more resilient to the issue of missing data that we currently face. In the upcoming weeks, as we conduct more thorough data cleaning and imputation, the other models will be refined and stabilized. As a result, they are likely to become more promising options for model selection than the decision tree.

# Next Steps
Our team is collaborating with DERConnect to obtain more comprehensive data and improve our understanding of the peripherals. We also intend to integrate energy pricing plans to conduct cost-benefit analyses using the insights we have gathered. Additionally, we are considering exploring the impact of the pandemic on energy usage.
